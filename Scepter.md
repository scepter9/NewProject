<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p>"Hey there! I’m a full-stack web developer with a passion for crafting digital experiences. I’m fueled by the thrill of turning ideas into reality, and I’m always eager to dive into new technologies and challenges. When I’m not hunched over my keyboard, you’ll likely find me strategizing my next chess move or exploring the latest tech trends. I’m particularly fond of SQL and Express.js, but I’m constantly expanding my skillset to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m immersed in a personal project that I’m excited to share soon. I’m also actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with talented teams and contribute to innovative projects. Let’s connect and build something amazing together!"</p>
